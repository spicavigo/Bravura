Bravura

Requirements:
  1. MongoDB
  2. Numpy
  3. Web2py

Bravura is time-series data visualization tool. It provides methods to store the data and perform various operations on it.
Operations currently supported are Standard Deviation, Mean, Rolling Mean, Aggregate, and Daily Change.

This is the first draft and I plan to improve it slowly.

Though I have mentioned that Bravura requires Web2py, you may use any other python server that you want. Files of importance in Bravura are

1. views/main.html
2. static/css/button.css
3. static/css/main.css
4. static/js/jquery.js
5. static/js/isotope.js
6. static/js/prototype.js
7. static/js/excanvas.js
8. static/js/lib/base64.js
9. static/js/canvas2image.js
10. static/js/canvastext.js
11. static/js/flotr.js
12. static/js/main.js
13. controllers/bravura.py

static/js/myscript.js shows how to instantiate Bravura

How to Run

Get web2py and put bravura inside the application folder

cd to bravura/controllers folder
open python shell

>>> from bravura import store
>>> data = [.... YOUR DATA ...]
>>> store(data)

YOUR DATA is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains "timestamp" along with data of other parameters
eg. {"timestamp": time.mktime(datetime(2012,1,1).timetuple()), "PARAM_A": <VALUE_A>, "PARAM_B":<VALUE_B>, ....}

Now that you are finished with loading data, start your web2py server and browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/bravura/bravura/index

If everything worked, then you should see the graphs for your data now.
